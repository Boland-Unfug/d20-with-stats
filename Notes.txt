Ok so version one has been made, it just contains this note, and the next version will contain imported libraries.
The process plan: 
1.) instantiate a die probability
1a.) ensure this is easily accessable, and adds up to 1 throughout the process and watch out for floating point errors
2.) add the ability to convolve using spipy fast convolve (xd6, 1d6 + 1d8)
2a.) this will be done by effectively giving operations like + convolution equivalents that are called in the background
2b.) add convolution shortcuts for die operations like advantage
3.) apply operations like + and -
4.) output a plot
